- Go into the "memeComps" folder and download a video (either Portait_Short for TikTok/Instagram or Landscape_Long for YouTube).
- Please make sure it is for today's date so you don't upload the same video twice.
- Then simply upload the video you have just downloaded to your social media of choice with a good title and description.

More video types (such as reddit stories) will come soon, but meme compilations are very easy to make.
